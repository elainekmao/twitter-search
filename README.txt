In the assignment folder, there is a folder called "twitter_search"

In that folder, open "index.html"

For my UI design, I chose to put the "Search" in the navigation bar, along with a dropdown menu of recent searches. 
I went with a minimalist design, and searches return entries where each entry is composed of the name of the user who posted the tweet, their twitter handle, and the text of the tweet. 

A "Loading..." text displays when you run a search so that the user knows their request is being processed.

The landing page gives the user some basic instructions on how to use the search. Important information about errors is in red to better catch the user's attention.
